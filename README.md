A full python tank couch game to play with friends or family.

A couch tanks game where you earn money, upgrade your tank and buy different ammo types.
You fight with others in well made maps, and you can create your own maps to play on with the SandBox feature!
There is a leaderboard, random air-drops, and much much more!
Also I added 3 music tracks, and menus for information.
 
Made with pygame COMPLETELY (In only 1 file with 1750 lines, Weird Challenge I know, I suffered so much finding anything...)

Also used python for the levels data and not json (because everything bust be with python)
